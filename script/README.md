# Instructions to run the script:

1. Install the required Python packages `boto3` and `urllib3`. These can be installed using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
pip install boto3
pip install urllib3
```

2. Set the following environment variables with the appropriate values:

- `URL`: the URL of the publicly available log file that you want to upload to S3
- `BUCKET_NAME`: the name of the S3 bucket where you want to store the log file
- `S3_KEY`: the key that will be used to name the log file in the S3 bucket

You can set environment variables in your terminal by running the following commands:

```
export URL=<URL>
export BUCKET_NAME=<BUCKET_NAME>
export S3_KEY=<S3_KEY>
```

3. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
python upload_to_s3.py
```

The script will download the log file from the specified URL and upload it to the specified S3 bucket using the specified key. If the upload is successful, the script will print a message indicating that the log file was uploaded to the S3 bucket. If there is an error, the script will print an error message.
